        Psychotherapy or Counseling
      </h2>

    <p class="words">
      <b>
        Psychotherapy or counseling, also known as talk therapy, involves talking about one's problems with a mental helth professional. It is one of the most common treatments for mental health disorders and there are many different types of psychotherapy, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). Talk therapy is usually done one-on-one, but can also be done in a group setting or with one's family. Pyschotherapy may also be useful for those going through challenging situations, but do not necessarily have a mental health condition.

        Support Groups

    <p class="words">
      <b>
        Support groups are a group of people that share common experiences and give each other encouragement, comfort, and advice. Support groups can help one gain insight into one's condition, as well as provide friendships, support, resources, and tips on how to live with a mental health condition. Some support groups may also offer educational opportunities, such as a guest doctor or psychologist to talk about a topic related to the group's needs. Support groups are not the same as group therapy sessions, but they do help participants feel less lonely, isolated, or judged about their mental health conditions.

        Prescription Medicine
      </h2>

    <p class="words">
      <b>
        Perscription medicine is also a common treatment method, alongside psychotherapy. Medicine for mental disorders alter the brain chemicals involved in emotions and thought patterns. Perscription medicines do not cure mental health conditions, but they can help improve one's symptoms. There are usually a variety of perscription medicines for each mental health condition, and each work in different ways. A psychiatrist can prescribe medication for mental health conditions and will share any side effects.

        Brain Stimulation Therapy (ex: ECT)
      </h2>

    <p class="words">
      <b>
        Electroconvulsive Therapy, also known as ECT, is a form of brain stimulation therapy. While the patient is under anesthesia, this procedure sends electric currents to the brain and causes changes in the brain that can improve or even reverse some symptoms. ECT is most commonly used in patients with severe Major Depression Disorder or Bipolar Disorder that have not responded to other treatments. Hence, brain stimulation therapies are often used when other treatments have not worked out.

        Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Therapy (EMDR)
      </h2>

    <p class="words">
      <b>
        Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Therapy, or EMDR, is a type of psychotherapy treatment used to relieve psychological stress. EMDR is an effective way to help alleviate trauma, especially for people with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). EMDR temporarily slows one's over-stimulated amygdala down and synchronises their brain waves to help process the traumatic memory. Essentially, EMDR walks one through their traumatic experience in order to rewire the brain to react differently to the event in the future.

      <b>
        Hospital or residential treatment programs are best sought when one's mental health issues become too severe that they need to receive treatment in a hospital or a long-term program. The signs to look out for if you need a hospital or residential treatment program is when you are unable to take care of yourself or are in danger of harming yourself or others.
