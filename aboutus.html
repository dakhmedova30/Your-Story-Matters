        Our goals are to create a welcoming and inclusive space for anyone who has struggled or is currently struggling with mental health issues, as well as anyone who wishes to educate themselves and learn more about mental health. We provide informative descriptions about a number of mental health disorders in the "Research" section to spread awareness about each one and shed light on these subjects. We encourage that if users utilize our "News" section and participate in researching if they wish to learn more about each mental health disorder or about conditions not listed on our website. Our "Support" section gives users short-term and long-terms solutions for dealing with mental health struggles, as well as advises a number of do's and don'ts when trying to help someone with a mental health condition. We advise that users who have mental health conditions or are in difficult situations to seek help and utilize our resources if needed.
        <br><br>
        The "News" section provides users with a list of mental health related articles and videos, which can be used to gain further insight on mental health conditions and how to act on them. Most of the resources are embedded, but you may click the title of each resource to directly bring you to the page. We also have a newly implemented "Pen Pal" section, in which users that have struggled or are currently struggling with mental health issues can submit a short form in order to be paired with a pen pal. Pen pals are mainly grouped by similar interests, and our team will do our best to contact you as soon as possible once we pair you with a pen pal. Lastly, in this section, the "About Us" section, we have our contact information listed on the sidebar in case if user have any comments or questions about our website. (Note: All of the contact information is currently fake.) If you have made it to the end of this paragraph, thank you so much for reading all of the way! We hope that this website was of good use to you and was able to assist you with any questions you may have had about mental health. Remember to take care of yourself and stay healthy, we will be cheering you on! Be sure to visit this website again in the future!
